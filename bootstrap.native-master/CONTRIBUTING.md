# Issue Reporting
Before posting a new issue/question, please check the [CLOSED](https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues section, maybe your issue have already been solved or your question was already answered.

Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native/issues) section to post new issues related to Native JavaScript for Bootstrap functionality, npm and / or node.js compatibility. 

**Requirements**
* **version** you are using, 
* **line number** of the script where the issue happens and any **console error** you may have,
* **step by step guide on reproducing the issue** and a **test site** are great for us to investigate and fix it,
* improvements must take into account the namespace of variables in `utils.js` and all files in the `/lib` folder. For instance you cannot define `Affix` or `offsetHeight` as variables for your scripts as they are already defined, all this to avoid clashes with various `node.js` apps we may build.


# Pull Requests
